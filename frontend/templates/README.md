# Cantiin Frontend: #
This is the frontend of the project.  
It works using normal HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The home page is index.html


## Functionality: ##
Frontend is not functional yet.  
The project is still under development, so I am doing my best 
 now to edit the backend to make it support the frontend.
